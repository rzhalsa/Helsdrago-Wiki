    * How does the dice roller work?
    
        The dice roller generates a random floating point number between 0(inclusive) and 1(exclusive).
        It then multiplies this result by the size of the dice (multiply by 100 for a d100, by 20 for a d20, etc)
        and adds 0.5 to that result to put the range of integers betewen 1 and the maximum value of the dice.
        When the result is output, it is rounded to the nearest whole integer.
        You can view the code for yourself at Scripts/Roller.js
